My site - [http://www.zhouhaibing.com][1] has many issues:

1. It is hosted on a place which I can not fully trust.
1. It is running on PHP which I am no longer interested at.
1. The way to publish content is pretty inconvenient.

With the move into Github Pages, I now feel more confortable to write since:

1. Hugo is written in Go, and I'm primarily working in Go.
1. This is now https enabled.
1. Posts can be written in Markdown, and is properly versioned with Git.

_As always, I know that building a site is easy, but producing good content is
hard. This is not just for people who are interested in my writtings, but for
myself, too._
